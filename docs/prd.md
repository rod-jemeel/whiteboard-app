# **Product Requirements Document: Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard**

* **Document Name:** Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard PRD  
* **Version:** 1.0  
* **Date:** July 8, 2025  
* **Author:** Gemini  
* **Purpose:** This document outlines the vision, goals, functional, and non-functional requirements for the Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard web application. It serves as a guide for development and ensures alignment on project scope.  
* **Target Audience:** Developers, Designers, Project Managers, Stakeholders.

## **1\. Product Vision**

To create an intuitive, real-time collaborative digital whiteboard that allows multiple users to simultaneously draw, sketch, and share ideas seamlessly. The application aims to provide a dynamic space for brainstorming, teaching, and visual communication, showcasing advanced web development capabilities including real-time data synchronization and robust user management.

## **2\. Goals & Objectives**

* **G1: Enable Real-time Collaboration:** Achieve near-instantaneous synchronization of drawing actions across all active users on a single whiteboard session.  
* **G2: Provide Core Drawing Functionality:** Implement essential drawing tools (pen, basic shapes, eraser) for a versatile user experience.  
* **G3: Ensure Data Persistence:** Allow users to save their whiteboard sessions and resume them later.  
* **G4: Implement Secure User Management:** Provide secure authentication (sign-up, login, logout) and ensure data privacy for user-created content.  
* **G5: Deliver a Responsive and Intuitive UI:** Create a user interface that is easy to navigate and functions well across various device sizes.

## **3\. User Stories / Use Cases**

As a **User**, I want to:

* **Authentication & Access:**  
  * Sign up for a new account using my email and password.  
  * Log in to my existing account.  
  * Log out of my account.  
  * Access whiteboards I have created or been invited to.  
* **Whiteboard Management:**  
  * Create a new whiteboard with a unique name.  
  * See a list of all whiteboards I have access to.  
  * Select an existing whiteboard to open and edit.  
  * Delete a whiteboard I own.  
* **Drawing & Interaction:**  
  * Select a freehand pen tool to draw lines.  
  * Choose different colors for my drawing tools.  
  * Adjust the thickness (size) of my drawing tools.  
  * Select an eraser tool to remove parts of the drawing.  
  * Draw basic shapes:  
    * Rectangle (filled or outlined).  
    * Circle (filled or outlined).  
    * Straight Line.  
  * See other users' drawing actions appear on the whiteboard in real-time.  
  * Have my drawings saved automatically as I draw.  
  * Clear the entire canvas of all drawings.

## **4\. Functional Requirements**

### **4.1. Authentication & Authorization**

* **FR1.1:** Users must be able to register a new account with email and password.  
* **FR1.2:** Users must be able to log in with their registered credentials.  
* **FR1.3:** Users must be able to log out from their session.  
* **FR1.4:** Only authenticated users can create, view, and edit whiteboards.  
* **FR1.5:** User-specific data (whiteboards, drawings) must be secured using Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

### **4.2. Whiteboard Management**

* **FR2.1:** Users can create new whiteboards, providing a name for each.  
* **FR2.2:** The application must display a dashboard listing all whiteboards accessible to the logged-in user.  
* **FR2.3:** Users can select a whiteboard from the dashboard to open it.  
* **FR2.4:** The owner of a whiteboard can delete it, which will also delete all associated drawings.

### **4.3. Drawing Tools**

* **FR3.1:** **Pen Tool:**  
  * Users can select a freehand drawing tool.  
  * Users can select a color for the pen (e.g., black, red, blue, green).  
  * Users can select a line thickness/size for the pen.  
* **FR3.2:** **Shape Tools:**  
  * Users can select a Rectangle tool to draw filled or outlined rectangles.  
  * Users can select a Circle tool to draw filled or outlined circles.  
  * Users can select a Line tool to draw straight lines.  
  * Shape tools should allow selection of color and line thickness (for outlines).  
* **FR3.3:** **Eraser Tool:**  
  * Users can select an eraser tool to remove drawn content.  
  * The eraser should function like a "white pen" or clear pixels in its path.  
* **FR3.4:** **Clear Canvas:**  
  * Users can click a button to clear all drawings from the current whiteboard. A confirmation dialog should be displayed.

### **4.4. Real-time Collaboration**

* **FR4.1:** All drawing actions (pen strokes, shape creations, erasures) performed by any user on a shared whiteboard must be broadcast and displayed in real-time to all other connected users.  
* **FR4.2:** The application must leverage Supabase Realtime for efficient and low-latency data synchronization.

### **4.5. Data Persistence**

* **FR5.1:** All completed drawing strokes and shapes must be automatically saved to the Supabase database.  
* **FR5.2:** When a user opens an existing whiteboard, all previously saved drawings for that whiteboard must be loaded and rendered on the canvas.

## **5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR1: Performance:**  
  * Real-time updates should appear with minimal perceived latency (ideally \< 100ms).  
  * The drawing experience should be smooth, without noticeable lag or choppiness.  
  * The application should efficiently handle multiple concurrent users (e.g., 5-10 users) on a single whiteboard.  
* **NFR2: Scalability:**  
  * The architecture should be capable of supporting a growing number of users and whiteboards. (Leveraging Supabase's managed services addresses this).  
* **NFR3: Security:**  
  * User authentication must be secure (Supabase Auth).  
  * Data access must be controlled via Supabase RLS to prevent unauthorized access to whiteboard data.  
  * API keys (Supabase anon key) should be handled securely (client-side anon key is acceptable for public access, but server-side service\_role key must *never* be exposed).  
* **NFR4: Usability & UX:**  
  * The user interface should be intuitive and easy to learn.  
  * Tool selection and color/size adjustments should be straightforward.  
  * The application must be fully responsive and provide a good user experience on desktop and mobile browsers.  
  * Clear visual feedback for tool selection and drawing actions.  
* **NFR5: Accessibility:**  
  * Basic keyboard navigation for UI elements.  
  * Sufficient color contrast for text and drawing elements.  
  * Consider ARIA attributes for interactive elements where appropriate.  
* **NFR6: Maintainability:**  
  * Codebase should be modular, well-commented, and follow React best practices.  
  * Clear separation of concerns (UI, drawing logic, Supabase integration).

## **6\. Technical Stack**

* **Frontend Framework:** React.js  
* **UI Library:** Supabase UI, Tailwind CSS (for general styling and responsiveness)  
* **Drawing API:** HTML Canvas API  
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase  
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL  
  * **Authentication:** Supabase Auth  
  * **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime (WebSockets)  
* **State Management:** React's useState, useRef, useContext (initially, can consider more advanced options like Zustand if complexity grows).

## **7\. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1.0)**

These features are considered for later versions beyond V2.0, or are lower priority.

* Version history for whiteboards.  
* Export whiteboard as image (PNG/JPG).

## **8\. Future Enhancements (V2.0 Plan)**

These features are planned for the next major iteration of the whiteboard application.

* **Text Tool:**  
  * Users can add editable text boxes to the whiteboard.  
  * Text boxes can be moved, resized, and edited by any collaborator.  
* **Image Upload Functionality:**  
  * Users can upload images to the whiteboard.  
  * Uploaded images can be moved and resized.  
* **Selection & Manipulation of Elements:**  
  * Users can select individual drawn elements (strokes, shapes, text, images).  
  * Selected elements can be moved, resized, and deleted.  
* **Undo/Redo Functionality:**  
  * Implement an undo/redo stack for drawing actions.  
* **Whiteboard Sharing & Permissions:**  
  * Allow whiteboard owners to invite other users to collaborate.

* **In-app Chat Functionality:**  
  * Provide a simple text-based chat for collaborators within a whiteboard session.  
* **User Presence Indicators:**
