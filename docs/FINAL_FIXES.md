# Final Fixes Applied

## 1. WebGL Context Lost Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: ShaderGradient causing "THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost" errors
**Solution**: Replaced with a simple CSS gradient background that won't crash

## 2. Invite Code Truncation - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Join page was limiting codes to 6 characters, but your codes are 8 characters
**Solution**: Updated maxLength from 6 to 8 characters

## 3. Invite Code Actually Works! ✅
The console shows it's working:
- `success: true`
- `whiteboard_id: "49ca2694-cc35-4e67-89ff-5029ccb86c5a"`
- Successfully redirecting to the whiteboard

## What's Happening Now

When you join with code `6D08F879`:
1. ✅ The RPC function finds the whiteboard
2. ✅ Adds you as a collaborator
3. ✅ Returns success with the whiteboard ID
4. ✅ Redirects to `/whiteboard/[id]`

The system is working correctly! The invite code successfully:
- Found the whiteboard
- Added the user as a collaborator
- Redirected to the whiteboard

## To Verify Everything Works

1. **Drawing Types**: Make sure you ran the SQL to fix drawing types
2. **Invite Codes**: The RPC function is working (as shown in console)
3. **No More WebGL Errors**: Simple gradient won't crash

## Quick Test
1. Create a whiteboard
2. Copy the 8-character invite code
3. Go to `/join` from another account
4. Enter the full 8-character code
5. You'll be redirected to the whiteboard

The invite system is now working as intended!
